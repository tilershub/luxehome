Ask a tiler who learned the trade twenty years ago and one who trained recently, and you may get different answers about adhesive versus mortar bed. Both methods work. Both have their place. Understanding the difference helps you ask the right questions when hiring a professional.

## What Is a Mortar Bed?

A mortar bed — also called a sand-cement bed or wet bed — is a thick layer of sand-cement mix (typically 40–70mm) floated and compacted over the substrate before tile is pressed in.

The method has been used for over a century. It is still the standard approach for:

- Shower floors requiring a precise gradient towards the drain
- Large commercial floors where the screed needs to level significant unevenness
- Heated floor systems in some configurations
- Areas where the substrate cannot bear the weight of a concrete screed overlay

**Advantages of mortar bed:**
- Allows the tiler to build in drainage falls on shower floors without relying on a pre-formed tray
- Creates an extremely solid, stable surface that does not flex
- Substrate imperfections (up to 40–50mm of variance) can be corrected within the bed itself
- Long-established technique with proven long-term results

**Disadvantages of mortar bed:**
- Slow — the bed must cure for 24–48 hours before tiling begins
- Heavy — adds significant weight to the floor, which matters in multi-storey buildings
- Requires skill to float correctly — a poor mortar bed causes the same lippage and hollow spots as a poor substrate
- Adds 50–70mm to the finished floor height, which affects door clearances and transition strips

## What Is Tile Adhesive?

Tile adhesive (also called thin-set or polymer-modified cement adhesive) is a factory-blended dry powder mixed with water on-site to a paste consistency, applied in a thin layer directly to the substrate.

Modern tile adhesives are polymer-modified, meaning they contain additives that dramatically improve bond strength, flexibility, and water resistance compared to old-style adhesives.

**Advantages of tile adhesive:**
- Faster — tiles can be grouted in 16–24 hours after laying
- Lighter — adds only 3–6mm to the floor height
- Consistent — factory blending removes variability from sand quality
- Better suited to large-format tiles (600mm+) where full-contact adhesive coverage is critical
- C2 and C2S2 rated adhesives offer deformability for surfaces that move slightly (e.g. timber sub-floors)

**Disadvantages of tile adhesive:**
- Cannot correct more than 3–5mm of substrate unevenness — the surface must be prepared first
- Not suitable for building drainage falls in shower floors — that work must be done in the screed before adhesive is applied
- Bond strength depends entirely on substrate preparation — adhesive on a dusty, weak, or contaminated surface will fail

## Which Is Used in Sri Lanka?

The overwhelming majority of residential tiling in Sri Lanka today uses polymer-modified tile adhesive, for good reason:

1. **Labour efficiency** — adhesive jobs can move from substrate to grouted floor in two days. Mortar bed adds at least a full day for the bed to cure.

2. **Large-format tiles** — 600×600mm and 800×800mm tiles dominate the market. These must be set in full-coverage adhesive, not mortar bed, to avoid hollow spots under the tile that cause cracking.

3. **Substrate quality** — modern concrete slabs and block walls in Sri Lankan construction are consistent enough that adhesive thickness (3–6mm) is sufficient with proper preparation.

4. **Weight** — in apartment buildings and multi-storey homes, every kilogram of screed added to a floor has a structural implication. Adhesive minimises this.

Mortar bed remains the correct method for shower floors — where the fall to the drain must be built in — and for any substrate with significant unevenness that cannot be corrected with a self-levelling compound.

## The Adhesive Rating System

Not all adhesives are equal. EN 12004 classifies tile adhesives:

| Class | Description | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Cementitious, standard | Light indoor tiling, dry areas |
| C2 | Cementitious, improved | Heavy duty, wet areas, large tiles |
| C2S1 | Improved + limited deformability | Wood sub-floors, underfloor heating |
| C2S2 | Improved + high deformability | Heavy movement, exterior use |

For bathroom floors, large-format tiles, and any exterior application, C2 or better is the correct specification. Using C1 adhesive on a 600×600mm floor tile in a wet area is a guarantee of future failure.

At TILERSHUB, we use C2 polymer-modified adhesive as standard on all floor tiling projects. We reserve mortar bed for shower floors where drainage gradients must be created.

## The Hidden Factor: Surface Preparation

Neither mortar bed nor adhesive will perform well on a poor substrate. Before any adhesive is applied:

- The surface must be structurally sound (no hollow sections, cracks, or delamination)
- It must be clean — free of dust, oil, curing compounds, and paint
- It must be primed if it is absorbent (bare concrete or block work draws moisture out of the adhesive too fast, reducing bond strength)
- It must be level within the tolerance of the adhesive system

This preparation is often the difference between a tile job that lasts 20 years and one that starts lifting within 5.

## Ask Before the Job Starts

If you are hiring a tiler, ask which adhesive they are specifying for your job. If they cannot name the product or the EN class, that is a sign of someone buying the cheapest bag at the hardware store — which is C1 standard and not appropriate for bathrooms or large-format tiles.

We are happy to advise on adhesive specification before any project begins. [WhatsApp us](/services/floor-tiling) with details of your project and tile size.
