After hundreds of residential tiling projects across Sri Lanka, we have seen the same mistakes appear again and again. Some are made by homeowners choosing the wrong products. Others are made by installers cutting corners. All of them are avoidable.

Here are the seven most common tiling mistakes — and exactly how to avoid each one.

## Mistake 1: Skipping Waterproofing in Wet Areas

This is the most expensive mistake in tiling and the most common. Grout and tile adhesive are not waterproof. Over time, water penetrates through the grout lines and reaches the substrate. Without a membrane between the tile and the structure, that water migrates into the wall cavity, the concrete, or the ceiling below.

The results — damp patches, efflorescence, mould, structural damage — appear gradually, sometimes years after installation. By the time the damage is visible, the fix involves stripping the entire tiled surface.

**How to avoid it:** Any wet area — shower walls, shower floor, bathroom floor, outdoor areas, balconies — must have a continuous waterproofing membrane applied before tiling begins. Sika or equivalent products, applied in two perpendicular coats, fully cured before adhesive goes on.

If a contractor tells you waterproofing is unnecessary because they are using a "waterproof adhesive," they are wrong. Adhesive is not a membrane.

## Mistake 2: Not Preparing the Substrate

Tile adhesive bonds to the substrate beneath it. If that substrate is weak, dusty, contaminated with oil, or structurally unsound, the adhesive will not hold — regardless of how expensive the adhesive is or how carefully the tiles are laid.

The most common substrate failures:

- **Dusty concrete** — the adhesive bonds to the dust layer, which has no structural connection to the concrete beneath
- **Painted walls** — adhesive rarely bonds reliably to paint; the paint peels and takes the tiles with it
- **Cracked or hollow render** — tiles over a hollow section will crack under foot traffic or temperature change
- **Wet substrate** — fresh concrete or newly wet areas need time to dry and cure before tiling

**How to avoid it:** Surfaces must be mechanically sound, clean, and primed before adhesive is applied. Hollow sections must be cut out and repaired. Painted surfaces must be scabbled or entirely stripped. Any professional tiler will spend time on surface preparation before laying the first tile — if they skip straight to tiling, that is a warning sign.

## Mistake 3: Using the Wrong Adhesive

Not all tile adhesives are the same, and the cheapest bag at the hardware store is almost certainly not the right product for a bathroom or a large-format tile.

Tile adhesives are classified under EN 12004. C1 is standard grade — fine for light indoor tiling in dry areas. C2 is improved — required for wet areas, heavy-duty applications, and any tile above 300×300mm. C2S1 and C2S2 add deformability for surfaces that flex (timber sub-floors, underfloor heating).

Using C1 adhesive on a 600×600mm bathroom floor tile is a failure waiting to happen.

**How to avoid it:** Ask your tiler what adhesive they are specifying. They should be able to name the product and its classification. If they cannot, or if they say "just the normal one," that is a problem.

## Mistake 4: Poor Tile Layout Planning

Experienced tilers spend time planning the layout before a single tile is laid. The starting point, tile orientation, and cut positions determine whether the finished result looks intentional or accidental.

Common layout mistakes:

- Starting from a corner and ending up with a 20mm sliver cut at the opposite wall
- Centring incorrectly so cuts are uneven on opposite sides of the room
- Not accounting for fixtures (toilet, vanity, shower) in the layout plan, resulting in awkward cuts around them
- Ignoring the pattern repeat on patterned tiles, causing discontinuous designs

**How to avoid it:** The correct starting point for most rooms is the visual centre — the point you see first when you enter. Tiles should be laid symmetrically from this point, with equal cuts at both ends of each wall. Dry-lay a row of tiles before mixing any adhesive to check the layout and make adjustments.

## Mistake 5: Grouting Too Soon

Tile adhesive needs time to cure before it can accept the weight and pressure of grouting. Grout applied too early can disturb the tiles, cause them to sink or shift, and result in a weakened bond beneath.

Most C2 adhesives require 16–24 hours before grouting. In humid conditions or thick adhesive beds, this can extend to 48 hours. Large-format tiles on floors need longer than small wall tiles.

**How to avoid it:** Read the adhesive manufacturer's instructions. If you press on a freshly laid tile and it has any movement, it is not ready to grout.

## Mistake 6: Using Non-Waterproof Grout in Wet Areas

Standard cementitious grout is porous. In a bathroom or kitchen, porous grout absorbs water, body oils, food residue, and cleaning chemicals. Within 2–3 years, it stains, discolours, and begins to harbour mould — especially in shower enclosures.

Regrouting is labour-intensive (the old grout must be raked out mechanically without damaging tiles) and disruptive. Doing it right the first time costs the same or less.

**How to avoid it:** Use waterproof, stain-resistant grout — labelled as such by the manufacturer — in any area exposed to moisture. We use Swisstek waterproof grout on all our projects. The joint colour you install on day one remains that colour.

## Mistake 7: Ignoring Lippage on Large Tiles

Lippage is the height difference between adjacent tiles — one edge sitting higher than its neighbour. On small tiles (100×100mm, 200×200mm), minor lippage is almost invisible. On large-format tiles (600×600mm, 800×800mm), even 1–2mm of lippage is visible and you catch your foot on it.

Lippage is caused by two things: substrate unevenness and inconsistent adhesive coverage. A floor that is not genuinely level, or adhesive applied without back-buttering large tiles, creates lippage that cannot be corrected after the adhesive cures.

**How to avoid it:** Large-format tiles require:

1. A genuinely level substrate (self-levelling compound if necessary)
2. Full-coverage adhesive application — both the floor and the back of each tile
3. A tile leveling system (wedge-and-clip or screw-type) that holds tiles perfectly co-planar while the adhesive cures

At TILERSHUB, we use a tile leveling system on every floor installation as standard. There is no other reliable way to guarantee zero lippage on large-format tiles.

**The common thread:** every mistake above comes down to either the wrong product, the wrong technique, or not allowing enough time. A professional tiler who has done this work for years has encountered every one of these failure modes — and has systems in place to avoid them.
