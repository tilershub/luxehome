The most common question we receive before a bathroom renovation is: "How much will it cost?" The honest answer is: it depends — but not in a way that avoids the question. Here is a realistic breakdown of every cost element in a Sri Lankan bathroom renovation, with figures current to 2025.

## What Drives Bathroom Renovation Cost

Three variables determine most of the cost difference between a basic renovation and a premium one:

1. **Tile selection** — the single biggest variable. Locally-produced tiles at Rs. 250–500/sq.ft versus imported porcelain at Rs. 800–2,000/sq.ft creates an enormous price gap before labour is even considered.

2. **Scope** — a cosmetic refresh (new tiles over existing) costs significantly less than a full strip-out with waterproofing.

3. **Fittings quality** — a basic WC and shower set from a local supplier costs Rs. 25,000–40,000. European or premium Asian fittings for the same combination cost Rs. 80,000–200,000.

## Labour Cost Breakdown

These are realistic 2025 rates for professional tiling work in Sri Lanka:

| Service | Rate |
|---|---|
| Bathroom renovation (full) | From Rs. 3,500/sq.ft |
| Bathroom tiling only (walls + floor) | Rs. 350–500/sq.ft |
| Waterproofing (Sika membrane) | Rs. 150–250/sq.ft |
| Shower floor with drainage fall | Rs. 800–1,200/sq.ft |
| Demountable glass partition | Rs. 18,000–35,000 (supply + install) |

Labour rates include adhesive, grout (Swisstek waterproof), and tile leveling system. They exclude tile supply.

## Tile Cost Breakdown

| Tile Type | Price Range (per sq.ft) |
|---|---|
| Local ceramic (wall) | Rs. 150–300 |
| Local vitrified (floor) | Rs. 220–400 |
| Imported porcelain (standard) | Rs. 450–800 |
| Imported porcelain (large format 600×1200) | Rs. 900–1,800 |
| Mosaic (glass or stone) | Rs. 1,200–3,500 |
| Natural marble (imported) | Rs. 2,000–6,000 |

Add 10–15% to all tile quantities for cut wastage. A tiler who quotes without including wastage is setting up a shortfall.

## Typical Project Budgets

### Small Bathroom Refresh — Rs. 80,000–150,000
- Bathroom size: 5–6 sq.ft floor, 30 sq.ft walls
- Existing waterproofing retained (tiles going over existing)
- Local vitrified floor tiles, local ceramic wall tiles
- Basic local fittings (shower head, mixer, accessories)
- No structural changes

### Mid-Range Renovation — Rs. 250,000–450,000
- Bathroom size: 8–12 sq.ft floor, 50–70 sq.ft walls
- Strip-out and Sika waterproofing
- Imported porcelain tiles (standard)
- Semi-premium fittings (Colombo-distributed brands)
- Shower niche or shelf built in
- Glass shower partition

### Premium Renovation — Rs. 600,000–1,200,000+
- Bathroom size: 12–20 sq.ft floor, 80–120 sq.ft walls
- Full gut, new screed, Sika waterproofing
- Large-format imported porcelain or marble feature wall
- Wall-hung WC with concealed cistern
- European fittings (Grohe, Hansgrohe, or equivalent)
- LED mirror, heated towel rail, built-in vanity cabinet
- Frameless glass shower enclosure

## Hidden Costs to Budget For

**Plumbing changes** — if you are moving a WC or relocating a shower drain, expect Rs. 15,000–40,000 for the plumbing work alone, plus cost of breaking and reinstating the floor.

**Electrical** — a new bathroom extraction fan, lighting circuit, or heated mirror requires a licensed electrician. Budget Rs. 8,000–20,000 depending on complexity.

**Door modifications** — raising a floor by 15–20mm (waterproof screed + tile) may require trimming the door. Rs. 2,000–5,000.

**Debris removal** — stripping a full bathroom generates significant rubble. If your contractor does not include this, arrange a skip or tractor separately.

**Wall repairs** — once tiles come off, you will find the original render condition. Some walls need significant patching before they can accept new tile. This is unknowable until the strip-out is complete — build a 10% contingency into your budget.

## What Cheap Quotes Are Cutting

When you receive a quote significantly below the figures above, something is being omitted. The most common omissions:

- **No waterproofing** — the single most consequential cut. A bathroom without waterproofing is a slow-developing leak problem.
- **C1 adhesive instead of C2** — half the cost, half the performance. Will begin to fail within 5–8 years in a wet environment.
- **No tile leveling system** — large tiles laid without a leveling system will have lippage (tiles at different heights). You see it every day and cannot unfeel it.
- **Non-waterproof grout** — standard cementitious grout stains, allows moisture penetration, and grows mould in the joints.

A renovation done without these elements will need redoing. The cost of doing it right once is always less than the cost of doing it twice.

## How to Get an Accurate Quote

To get a quote you can actually compare between contractors:

1. Provide the bathroom dimensions (floor area and wall area separately)
2. Specify what tiles you are buying and their format (e.g. 300×600mm porcelain)
3. State the scope: strip-out or tile-over, waterproofing included or not
4. List what fittings are supply-only (you buy) versus supply-and-install

A quote that covers all of the above gives you an apples-to-apples comparison. A quote that just says "bathroom renovation Rs. X" cannot be meaningfully compared to anything.
