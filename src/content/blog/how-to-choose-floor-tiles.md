The tiles you choose do more than fill a floor. They set the tone of the room, determine how safe and easy to clean the surface is, and — once laid — are essentially permanent. Getting the choice wrong is expensive to reverse. Getting it right lasts decades.

Here is what to consider before you buy a single tile.

## 1. Start With the Room, Not the Tile

Before looking at samples, think about where the tiles are going and what that space demands:

**Bathrooms and wet areas** need surfaces that are safe underfoot when wet. A polished tile that looks stunning in the showroom becomes dangerous in a shower. Look for an anti-slip rating of R10 or higher for any area that gets wet.

**Kitchens** deal with oil splatter, food stains, and heavy foot traffic. A matte or semi-polished finish handles daily cooking better than a high-gloss surface that shows every mark.

**Living rooms and bedrooms** are dry, lower-wear environments — you have more freedom here. Large-format tiles, polished finishes, and lighter colours all work well.

**Outdoor areas, balconies, and terraces** need tiles with a low water absorption rate and a textured grip surface. Sri Lanka's climate means freeze-thaw is not a concern, but rain and humidity are. Choose a tile rated for exterior use.

## 2. Get the Size Right

Tile size affects both the visual result and the demands placed on installation.

Large-format tiles — 600×600mm, 800×800mm, and larger — create a seamless, premium look and make rooms feel more spacious. But they require a floor that is genuinely level. Any dip or rise shows immediately on a large tile. At TILERSHUB, we apply a tile leveling system on every floor job to ensure zero lippage regardless of tile size.

For most Sri Lankan homes, a practical size guide:

| Space | Recommended Size |
|---|---|
| Living room | 600×600mm or 800×800mm |
| Bedroom | 600×600mm |
| Bathroom floor | 300×300mm or 300×600mm |
| Bathroom wall | 300×600mm or 600×600mm |
| Kitchen countertop | 300×600mm |
| Staircase | Step-cut with nosing |

We work with tiles up to 4×2 feet. Anything over 600mm requires a leveling system — which we use as standard on every installation.

## 3. Understand the Materials

**Porcelain** is the most versatile and highest-performing tile material. It is denser and harder than ceramic, absorbs very little water (< 0.5%), and handles both indoor and outdoor use. The higher price is justified — especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and high-traffic areas. If you are unsure what to choose, default to porcelain.

**Ceramic** is lighter and more porous than porcelain. It works well in dry indoor areas (bedrooms, living rooms) and typically costs less. Not suitable for outdoor use or heavily wet areas.

**Vitrified tiles** are ceramic tiles fired at very high temperatures, which creates a glass-like surface with very low water absorption. Suitable for most indoor and sheltered outdoor applications. A good mid-point between standard ceramic and full porcelain.

**Natural stone** (granite, marble, limestone) delivers unmatched character but requires sealing, more careful maintenance, and precise installation. Best used by experienced tilers who understand the material.

## 4. Choose the Right Finish

| Finish | Best Used For | Caution |
|---|---|---|
| Polished / Glossy | Living rooms, formal areas | Slippery when wet — avoid in bathrooms |
| Matte | Bathrooms, kitchens, high-traffic areas | Can feel flat if the colour is not right |
| Textured / Anti-slip | Wet areas, staircases, outdoor | Slightly harder to mop; grout lines are more visible |
| Lappato (semi-polished) | Living rooms, bedrooms | A good balance between sheen and practicality |

## 5. Grout Colour Is Not an Afterthought

Grout covers 10–15% of a tiled surface. Get it wrong and the entire floor looks off.

- **Match grout to tile** for a seamless, expansive feel
- **Contrast grout** (dark grout with light tiles) adds definition and tends to hide dirt better over time
- **Always use stain-resistant, waterproof grout** in any wet or kitchen area

We use Swisstek waterproof grout on every project — consistent colour, stain-resistant, and long-lasting.

## 6. Ask Before You Buy

A few minutes with your tiler before purchasing can save significant money and frustration. A good installer will confirm:

- Whether your chosen tile suits the surface it is going on
- Exactly how many you need including cut wastage (typically 10–15%)
- Whether the format or finish requires any special adhesive or method

We are happy to advise on tile selection before any project begins. [WhatsApp us](/services/floor-tiling) with a photo of the space and what you are considering — we will give you an honest answer.
