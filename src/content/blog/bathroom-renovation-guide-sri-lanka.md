A bathroom renovation is one of the highest-impact upgrades you can make to a home. Done well, it adds value, improves daily comfort, and lasts 15–20 years without issue. Done poorly, it leaks, grows mould, and costs more to fix than it would have to do correctly the first time.

This guide walks through every stage of a bathroom renovation — from deciding what to change to handing over a finished space.

## 1. Decide What You Are Actually Changing

Bathroom renovations range from cosmetic refreshes to full gut-and-rebuild projects. Be clear about your scope before getting quotes:

**Cosmetic refresh** — New tiles over existing tiles (if substrate is sound), new fittings, new accessories. Low disruption, lower cost.

**Partial renovation** — Remove existing tiles, re-waterproof, re-tile, replace fittings. The most common scope for Sri Lankan homes. Gets you a properly waterproofed bathroom with a new look.

**Full renovation** — Change the layout, relocate the shower or WC, replace plumbing, new ceiling, full electrical. Higher cost and requires a plumber and electrician in addition to your tiler.

Most renovations in Sri Lanka fall into the partial category. If the existing waterproofing is failing (damp on exterior walls, cracked grout, persistent musty smell), you need at least a partial renovation — not just a tile replacement.

## 2. Plan the Layout Before Anything Else

If you are keeping the existing layout, skip this step. If you want to move a shower or add one, plan carefully:

- **Drain placement** drives everything. Moving a floor drain is expensive and involves breaking the screed.
- **Wet zone vs dry zone** — separate the toilet area from the shower area with layout, height differences, or glass partitioning. This keeps the floor safer and drier.
- **Ventilation** — every enclosed shower area needs either a window or an extraction fan. Without airflow, mould is inevitable regardless of waterproofing quality.
- **Storage** — plan for a niche, shelf, or built-in cabinet before tiling begins. Adding these after is disruptive.

Sketch the layout on paper with dimensions before committing.

## 3. Waterproofing: The Most Important Step Nobody Sees

This is where most DIY renovations and cheap jobs fail.

Bathroom floors and wet walls need a continuous waterproof membrane before any tile is laid. Water travels through grout and adhesive over time. If there is no membrane, it reaches the screed, the concrete, and eventually the wall cavity or the ceiling below.

At TILERSHUB, we apply Sika waterproofing membrane to all wet areas:

- Full floor coverage extending 300mm up every wall
- Full shower wall coverage to ceiling height in enclosed showers
- Two coats — the second applied perpendicular to the first
- Curing time respected before tiling begins

A bathroom without proper waterproofing is not a finished bathroom. It is a slow leak.

## 4. Choose Tiles That Suit a Bathroom

Bathrooms demand tiles selected for performance, not just appearance.

**Floor tiles** must have an anti-slip rating. Look for R10 or higher. Polished or semi-polished tiles look beautiful but are dangerous when wet. Textured matte surfaces are the correct choice for any bathroom floor.

**Wall tiles** can be smooth and polished — they are not walked on. A glossy wall tile reflects light and makes the space feel larger. Rectified tiles (precision-cut to exact dimensions) allow thinner grout lines, which look cleaner.

**Recommended tile sizes for bathrooms:**

| Surface | Recommended Size |
|---|---|
| Shower floor | 100×100mm or 200×200mm (small = more grout = more grip) |
| Bathroom floor | 300×300mm or 300×600mm |
| Shower walls | 300×600mm or 600×600mm |
| Feature wall | 300×600mm or custom mosaic |

**Porcelain** is the correct material for all wet areas — low water absorption, durable, and available in every finish. Ceramic is acceptable for dry bathroom walls. Avoid natural stone in shower areas unless you are committed to regular sealing.

## 5. Grout Selection Matters

In a bathroom, all grout must be:

- **Waterproof** — standard cementitious grout is porous and will absorb moisture over time, causing staining and mould
- **Stain-resistant** — bathroom grout is exposed to soap, body oils, and cleaning products daily
- **Colour-stable** — cheap grout fades and patches unevenly

We use Swisstek waterproof grout on all bathroom projects. The colour you install on day one is the colour it stays.

**Grout width:** Keep joints at 2–3mm for wall tiles and 3–5mm for floor tiles. Wider joints require sanded grout; narrower joints need unsanded or epoxy grout. Your tiler will advise based on your tile size and rectification quality.

## 6. Fittings and Fixtures

Tiles and waterproofing are the structure. The fittings are what you interact with daily.

- **Shower heads and mixers** — choose quality fittings that match in finish. Mismatched metals age badly.
- **WC suite** — wall-hung or floor-standing. Wall-hung makes the floor easier to clean.
- **Vanity and basin** — recessed basin (in a countertop) or wall-hung are both easier to keep clean than pedestal basins.
- **Mirror and lighting** — backlit mirrors add both function and atmosphere. Position lighting above eye level so it does not cast shadows on your face.
- **Towel rails and accessories** — these are drilled into tiles. Plan their positions before tiling is complete so the tiler can leave anchor points in the right locations.

## 7. The Renovation Sequence

Order of operations matters. A renovation done out of sequence costs more to fix.

1. **Strip out** — remove existing tiles, fittings, and screed if necessary
2. **Plumbing and electrical rough-in** — move pipes and conduits before waterproofing
3. **Substrate preparation** — level the floor, patch walls, confirm drainage falls correctly
4. **Waterproofing** — apply membrane, cure fully
5. **Tiling** — floor first, then walls; use leveling system on floor
6. **Grouting** — after adhesive has fully cured (minimum 24 hours)
7. **Silicone sealing** — all internal corners and junctions between floor and wall
8. **Fittings installation** — plumber fits shower, WC, taps; electrician completes lighting
9. **Accessories** — towel rails, toilet roll holder, mirror

## 8. What to Ask Your Contractor

Before signing off on any renovation quote, confirm:

- Is waterproofing membrane included? Which product?
- Does the quote include tile adhesive and grout, or are these extra?
- Is tile wastage (10–15% for cuts and breakage) included in the tile quantity?
- What tile leveling system do you use?
- How long will the project take, and what is the daily working schedule?

A legitimate contractor will answer all of these without hesitation.
