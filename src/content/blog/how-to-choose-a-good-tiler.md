Many Sri Lankans living in Australia, the UK, the Middle East, Italy, or elsewhere own property back home — an inherited family house, a plot being built on, or an apartment being renovated for rental income. Coordinating a tiling or renovation project from thousands of kilometres away is stressful, and the biggest risk is hiring the wrong person.

This guide is for you: the overseas Sri Lankan trying to get a bathroom or floor done properly without being there to oversee it yourself.

## Why Tiling Quality Varies So Much in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka does not have a formal licensing system for tilers. Anyone with a bucket of adhesive and a trowel can call themselves a contractor. This means quality ranges from genuinely excellent craftsmanship to work that starts failing within a few years — tiles cracking, grout moulding, bathrooms leaking into the ceiling below.

The gap between a skilled professional tiler and an unskilled one is not visible on day one. It shows up 18 months later when tiles start lifting, or when you visit home and find the bathroom smells of damp despite looking "fine."

Knowing how to screen a tiler before the job starts is the only protection you have.

## 1. Ask for Past Work — Real Photos, Not Stock Images

Any tiler worth hiring has photos of completed projects. Before agreeing to anything, ask:

- "Can you send me photos of your last three bathroom renovations?"
- "Do you have any ongoing projects I could see on video call?"

Genuine craftsmen photograph their own work because they are proud of it. If the response is hesitation, stock images, or blurry phone photos that could be from anywhere, that is a warning sign.

When reviewing photos, look for:

- **Straight grout lines** — a wandering grout joint reveals inconsistent tile spacing
- **Clean internal corners** — silicone bead in corners should be smooth and uniform, not blob-applied
- **Consistent tile height** — especially on floors, there should be no visible lippage (one tile edge raised above the next)
- **Neat tile cuts around fixtures** — the cut edge around a toilet base, a drain, or a door frame reveals real skill level

## 2. Ask Specifically About Waterproofing

This is the question that separates professional tilers from casual ones. Ask:

> "What waterproofing system do you use for bathrooms?"

A professional will name a product — Sika, Fosroc, Parex, or equivalent — and describe the application method (membrane, two coats, perpendicular application, cure time before tiling).

If the answer is "we use waterproof cement" or "the tiles themselves are waterproof" or any version of "don't worry about that" — end the conversation. Tiles and adhesive are not waterproofing membranes. A bathroom without a proper membrane is a guaranteed future problem.

For an overseas owner who will not be living in the property full-time, a bathroom leak can go undetected for months, causing structural damage that costs many times more than the original renovation to repair.

## 3. Ask What Adhesive They Use and Why

This question reveals knowledge level immediately. C2-rated polymer-modified adhesive is the correct product for bathrooms and for any tile 300mm or larger. Standard C1 adhesive costs half as much and performs at half the level.

Ask: "What tile adhesive do you use for bathroom floors?"

A knowledgeable answer names the product (Swisstek, Lanko, Weber, Mapei) and mentions the classification. An unknowledgeable answer says "the normal one from Keells or Arpico."

The product used inside the wall is invisible after the job is done. You cannot check it afterwards. You have to trust that the right product was used — which means verifying knowledge before the job starts.

## 4. Get an Itemised Quote, Not a Lump Sum

A quote that says "bathroom renovation — Rs. 75,000" tells you nothing. An itemised quote tells you everything:

- Labour (sq.ft rate, number of square feet)
- Waterproofing membrane (product, sq.ft, rate)
- Tile adhesive (product, kg, rate)
- Grout (product, kg, rate)
- Tile leveling system (yes or no — this matters for large tiles)
- Waste removal (included or separate)

If a tiler will not provide an itemised quote, it is because they do not want you to see what they are cutting. Getting quotes from two or three contractors with the same specification lets you compare apples to apples.

For overseas owners, an itemised quote also serves as documentation — if something goes wrong, you have a written record of what was agreed and what products were to be used.

## 5. Understand Who Is Actually Doing the Work

In Sri Lanka, it is common for a middleman contractor to take your job and subcontract the actual tiling to day-labourers. You hire a person with a phone and a business card; strangers show up to do the work.

This is not always a problem — some contractors manage their teams well. But it becomes a problem when quality issues arise and there is no accountability.

Ask directly: "Will you personally be on-site for this job, or will you be managing a team?"

A team is acceptable. What you want to confirm is that the person quoting you — the one accountable to you — will be present and responsible for quality, not simply collecting a margin and disappearing.

## 6. Arrange Video Call Check-Ins During the Job

Managing a renovation remotely requires a communication protocol agreed in advance. Before work starts, establish:

- A daily photo or video update at end of each working day
- A video call before waterproofing is applied (to inspect substrate preparation)
- A video call before tiling starts (to review waterproofing and confirm it is cured)
- A final video walkthrough before payment is completed

A trustworthy contractor will agree to this without hesitation. Pushback on this request is a significant red flag — if they are unwilling to show you the work in progress, ask yourself why.

## 7. Do Not Pay the Full Amount Upfront

This applies to all contracting work, not just tiling. A reasonable payment structure for a bathroom renovation:

- **30–40% on start** — to cover materials
- **30–40% at mid-point** (after tiling is complete, before grouting)
- **20–30% on completion** — after a full video walkthrough and your sign-off

Paying in full upfront removes all your leverage. If the work is substandard, your only recourse is moral persuasion. Holding back the final payment keeps the contractor motivated to finish properly and address any snagging items.

## 8. Check References From Previous Overseas Clients

If a tiler has worked with overseas Sri Lankan clients before, they should be able to provide a reference — someone who managed a similar project remotely and can speak to the experience.

Ask: "Have you worked with clients who were not in Sri Lanka during the renovation? Can I speak to one?"

A contractor who has successfully managed remote-client projects understands the communication requirements and has systems in place. A contractor who has never done it may genuinely lack the discipline or processes that remote management requires.
